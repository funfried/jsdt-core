Forked from [revelc/jsdt-core] as there were incompatibility issues with the embedded [Google Guava] library and other libraries that needed a newer version of [Google Guava].

A small [Tycho] project which repackages the jsdt-core library from the
[Eclipse] project into a bundle to publish to [Maven Central] to use as a
dependency in other [Maven] projects, such as [formatter-maven-plugin].
